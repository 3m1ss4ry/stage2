## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) installed and a database set up.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/3m1ss4ry/stage2.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd stage2
Install the project dependencies:
npm install

Configure the database connection by editing the config/config.json file with your MySQL credentials.

Run the migration to create the necessary database tables:
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

Start the API server:
npm start

Your API should now be running locally at http://localhost:3000 (or the specified port).

Usage
To interact with the API, you can use tools like Postman or send HTTP requests using your preferred method. Here are some sample requests:

Create a Person:

POST http://localhost:3000/api/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30
}
Read a Person:

GET http://localhost:3000/api/1
Update a Person:

PUT http://localhost:3000/api/1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Updated Name",
  "age": 35
}
Delete a Person:

DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/1
Error Handling
The API handles errors gracefully and returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages in the response. Common error scenarios include validation errors, not found (404), and server errors (500).

Security Considerations:
Ensure that your API is only accessible over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms as needed to restrict access.
Validate user input to prevent SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities.
Apply rate limiting to prevent abuse and DoS attacks.
Keep your dependencies up-to-date to patch security vulnerabilities.
